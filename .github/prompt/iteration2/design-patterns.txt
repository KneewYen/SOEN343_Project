# Design Patterns for BikeShare Login/Registration System (Iteration 2)

## Pattern 1: [Fill in Pattern Name - e.g., Repository Pattern]

### Justification:
- [Fill in - Why did you choose this pattern?]
- [Fill in - What problem does it solve in your authentication system?]
- [Fill in - How does it improve your code architecture?]
- [Fill in - Benefits for testing/maintainability]

### Implementation:
- **Classes involved:**
  - [Fill in - Interface/Abstract class name]
  - [Fill in - Concrete implementation class]
  - [Fill in - Client classes that use it]
- **UML diagram location:** [Fill in - path to your UML class diagram]
- **Key methods:**
  - [Fill in - main method signatures]
  - [Fill in - important operations]

### Code Structure:
```
[Fill in - brief code structure example showing the pattern]
interface SomeRepository {
    // method signatures
}

class ConcreteSomeRepository implements SomeRepository {
    // implementation
}
```

## Pattern 3: [Fill in Third Pattern Name - e.g., Factory Pattern]

### Justification:
- [Fill in - How does this pattern help with object creation?]
- [Fill in - What abstraction does it provide?]
- [Fill in - Benefits for your user/role management?]

### Implementation:
- **Classes involved:**
  - [Fill in - Factory class/interface]
  - [Fill in - Product classes]
  - [Fill in - Client code]
- **UML diagram location:** [Fill in - diagram location]
- **Key methods:**
  - [Fill in - factory methods]
  - [Fill in - creation logic]

### Code Structure:
```
[Fill in - factory pattern example structure]
```

## [Optional] Pattern 4: [Fill in Fourth Pattern if implementing more]

### Justification:
- [Fill in - additional pattern reasoning]

### Implementation:
- **Classes involved:** [Fill in]
- **UML diagram location:** [Fill in]
- **Key methods:** [Fill in]

---

## UML Class Diagrams Required:

### Pattern Implementation Diagrams
Create separate UML class diagrams for each pattern showing:
- [Fill in - class relationships]
- [Fill in - method signatures]
- [Fill in - dependencies and associations]
- [Fill in - multiplicity where relevant]

### Suggested Diagram Locations:
- `docs/patterns/pattern1-class-diagram.png`
- `docs/patterns/pattern2-class-diagram.png`
- `docs/patterns/pattern3-class-diagram.png`

### Pattern Integration
[Fill in - describe how your patterns work together in the overall system]
